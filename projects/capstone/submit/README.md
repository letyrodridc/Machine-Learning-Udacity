# Udacity's Machine Learning Nanodegree Capstone Project
April 2018

### About this project

This is the code and documenation of the my capstone project for the Udacity's Deep Learning Nanodegree Program.

I choose to build a CNN for detecting if a product brought in the supermaket or grocery store should be store in the fridge or not.

I used the Precios Claros images dataset.

### Introduction

There are huge advancements in Robotics that helps in Supermarkets orders
fulfillment, checking, and maintaining stock. However, the products are
bought for millions of people and took it into their home, and they donâ€™t have
robots to help you with the everyday chores.

At home, the storage of grocery products could be simplified to this item
should go in the fridge or not. To preserve the conservation chain, some
products need to be stored in the refrigerator.

The idea is to build a system that can detect if an item should be stored in
the fridge or not, using Deep Learning.

So, the problem is simplified to a bi-categorical classification: Fridge or not
Fridge.


### Dataset

The dataset was classified as fridge or non-fridge product and stored in:
